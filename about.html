            <p>Stéphane has a strange and varied history of jobs, world-views, and injuries.
            Growing up with a continental philosopher as a father, he pronounced early on that philosophy
            was not going to be his job. This, of course, set him up for a later doom of studying and teaching
            yoga and Buddhism. On the way there Stéphane worked in and crashed out of the first internet
            boom as a database manager, spent seven years working post-production on the Bachelor, met the
            woman who became his wife, became an itinerant student and teacher until settling as a yoga teacher
            in San Francsico in 2013. He likes, in no particular order and far from comprensively, Arya Nagarjuna,
            Thomas Pynchon, Macross, video games and not having the time for them, and the Bay Area. He loves
            wife and son and his extended family. Oh, Stéphane also seems to like programming. Let's hope
            that lasts!</p>
